# Transforming-Waste-Management-with-Transfer-Learning
An Intelligent Waste Classification Web Application Using TensorFlow and Flask

Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-powered web application that classifies waste images into categories such as cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. It leverages transfer learning with MobileNetV2 to accurately identify waste types and provides useful environmental information including recyclability and degradability.

The app is built using TensorFlow for deep learning and Flask as the web framework, enabling users to upload waste images and get instant predictions with confidence scores.

Features
Image Upload: Simple web form to upload images of waste.

Waste Classification: Classifies images into 6 waste categories using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model.

Environmental Labels: Displays if waste is recyclable or non-recyclable and degradable or non-degradable.

Confidence Scores: Shows prediction certainty as a percentage.

Image Preview: Displays the uploaded image for verification.

User-Friendly Interface: Clean, centered layout for ease of use.

Technologies Used
TensorFlow 2.x: Deep learning framework for model training and inference.

MobileNetV2: Pre-trained CNN model used for transfer learning.

Flask: Lightweight web framework to build the frontend and backend.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics (optional).

Matplotlib: For training visualization (optional).

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd waste-management-app
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the trained model file waste_classifier_model.h5 in the project root.

Create uploads folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p static/uploads
Usage
Start the Flask application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Open your browser and go to:

cpp
Copy
Edit

Upload an image of waste via the form and submit.

View the predicted waste category, recyclability, degradability, and confidence score.

How It Works
The Flask app handles HTTP requests, manages image uploads, and serves the web pages.

Uploaded images are saved in static/uploads.

The TensorFlow model processes the uploaded image, returning a predicted class and confidence.

The app maps the prediction to environmental labels for recyclability and degradability.

Results and uploaded image are dynamically rendered on the web page.

Model Training (Optional)
If you want to retrain or fine-tune the model:

Use transfer learning with MobileNetV2.

Apply data augmentation for better generalization.

Train using the dataset structured by waste categories.

Save the model as waste_classifier_model.h5.

Environment Labels
